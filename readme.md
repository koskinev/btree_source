# About    

This repository contains a copy of the source code for the `BTreeMap` and `BTreeSet` types from the Rust standard library. Minimal changes to the code were made to it to compile as a stand-alone library and pass all the tests. The original source code was downloaded on 2022-06-04 from https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/library/alloc/src/collections/btree. Tests were run on Rust 1.61.0 stable. 

The library is intended to work as a reference and basis for implementing other tree data structures in Rust. 

I'm releasing this in case someone finds it useful, but I'm not planning to keep it updated and cannot provide any support.
