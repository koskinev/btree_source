# Standalone BTreeMap and BTreeSet types from the Rust standard library    

This repository contains copies of the implementations of the `BTreeMap` and `BTreeSet` types from the Rust standard library. Minimal changes to the code were made to it to compile and pass the tests. Tests were run on Rust 1.61.0 stable. The original source code was downloaded on 2022-06-04 from https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/library/alloc/src/collections/btree 

The library is intended to work as a reference and basis for implementing other tree data structures in Rust. 

I'm releasing this in case someone find's it useful, but I'm not planning to keep it updated and cannot provide any support.
